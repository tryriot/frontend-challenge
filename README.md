# Riot frontend challenge

Hi there!

Since you got here, you're probably taking a part in our recruitment process for Front-end developer position, right?

We're super happy to hear that! Getting right to it — the main purpose of this test is to check out your frontend skills. We'd like to get to know your approach of solving the following problems:

- Implement functionalities for the User stories (first one is already done).
- Use Vue.js UI library with its related ecosystem parts like [Vue Apollo](https://apollo.vuejs.org/) and [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/).
- Use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utiliy-first css framework.
- Provide the best possible User Experience (being strict with the designs, responsiveness, hover/focus states of interactive elements — everything to your liking and ideas).
- Write a code that follows project's guidelines (e.g linters).

Feel free to open an issue if you got any questions or suggestions! Once it's ready, send us a repository link at louis@tryriot.com.

Happy coding and cheers,

Louis, CTO @ Riot
