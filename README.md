# Riot frontend challenge

Hi there!

Since you're here, you're probably taking part in our recruitment process for a front-end developer position, right?

We're super happy to hear that! Getting right to it â€” the main purpose of this test is to check out your front-end skills. We'd like to get to know your approach of solving the following problems:

- Implement functionalities from user stories.
- Use Vuejs library with Typescript.
- Use the GraphQL api endpoint to get the data.
- Use Tailwind CSS for CSS.
- Provide the best possible User Experience (being strict with the designs, responsiveness, hover/focus states of interactive elements everything to your liking and ideas).

Feel free to open an issue if you got any questions or suggestions! Once it's ready, send us a repository link at louis@tryriot.com.

Happy coding and cheers,

Louis, CTO @ Riot
