# Riot frontend challenge

Hey you,

Since you got here, you're probably taking a part in our recruitment process for Front-end developer position, right?

We're super happy to hear that! Getting right to it — the main purpose of this task is to check out your frontend skills. We'd like to get to know your aproach of solving the following problems:

- Implement functionalities for the User stories (first one is already done).
- Use Vuejs UI library with it's related ecosystem parts like Vue-Apollo and Vue-Router.
- Use tailwindcss, a utiliy-first css framework.
- Provide the best possible User Experience (being strict with the designs, responsiveness, hover/focus states of interactive elements — everything to your liking and ideas).
- Write a code that follows project's guidelines (e.g linters).

Feel free to open an issue if you got any questions or sugestions! Once it's ready, send us a repository link at louis@tryriot.com

Happy coding and cheers,

Louis, Riot
